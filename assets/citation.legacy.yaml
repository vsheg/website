    Various methods (Hartree–Fock methods, semi-empirical methods, Density
    Functional Theory, Molecular Mechanics) used to optimize a molecule
    structure feature the same basic approach but differ in the mathematical
    approximations used. The geometry optimization procedure calculates the
    energy at an initial geometry of a molecule and then proceeds to search a
    new geometry with a lower energy. Using the 3D structures collected from the
    PubChem database, 20 amino acid geometry optimization calculations were
    performed with several methods. The purpose of the study was to analyze
    these methods (39) to find the relationship between them and to determine
    which to use under different circumstances. Cluster analysis and principal
    component analysis were performed to evaluate the similarities between the
    different methods. The results after the analysis can classified into three
    main groups and can be selected accordingly to solve different types of
    problems.

    We present a method for determining the free-energy dependence on a selected
    number of collective variables using an adaptive bias. The formalism
    provides a unified description which has metadynamics and canonical sampling
    as limiting cases. Convergence and errors can be rigorously and easily
    controlled. The parameters of the simulation can be tuned so as to focus the
    computational effort only on the physically relevant regions of the order
    parameter space. The algorithm is tested on the reconstruction of an alanine
    dipeptide free-energy landscape. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

  abstract: >-
    Metadynamics is a powerful technique for enhancing sampling in molecular
    dynamics simulations and reconstructing the free-energy surface as a
    function of few selected degrees of freedom, often referred to as collective
    variables (CVs). In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a
    history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the
    space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have
    been made to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and
    accurate method that has found many successful applications in several
    domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying
    metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the
    crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible
    strategies to alleviate this difficulty. Later in the second part, we
    present a few recent representative applications, which we have classified
    into three main classes: solid-state physics, chemical reactions, and
    biomolecules. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

    If the rotational motion of a single macromolecule is constrained during a
    molecular dynamics simulation with periodic boundary conditions it is
    possible to perform such simulations in a computational box with a minimal
    amount of solvent. In this article we describe a method to construct such a
    box, and test the approach on a number of macromolecules, randomly chosen
    from the protein databank. The essence of the method is that the molecule is
    first dilated with a layer of at least half the cut-off radius. For the
    enlarged molecule a near-densest lattice packing is calculated. From this
    packing the simulation box is derived. On average, the volume of the
    resulting box proves to be about 50% of the volume of standard boxes. In
    test simulations this yields on average a factor of about two in simulation
    speed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations the need often arises to maintain
    such parameters as temperature or pressure rather than energy and volume, or
    to impose gradients for studying transport properties in nonequilibrium MD.
    A method is described to realize coupling to an external bath with constant
    temperature or pressure with adjustable time constants for the coupling. The
    method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be
    applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints. The
    influence of coupling time constants on dynamical variables is evaluated. A
    leap-frog algorithm is presented for the general case involving constraints
    with coupling to both a constant temperature and a constant pressure bath. ©

    During the final stages of cell-wall synthesis in bacteria,
    penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) catalyse the cross-linking of peptide
    chains from adjacent glycan strands of nascent peptidoglycan. We have
    recently shown that this step can be bypassed by an l,d-transpeptidase,
    which confers high-level β-lactam-resistance in Enterococcus faecium. The
    resistance bypass leads to replacement of d-Ala4→d-Asx-l-Lys3 cross-links
    generated by the PBPs by l-Lys3→d-Asx-l-Lys3 cross-links generated by the
    l,d-transpeptidase. As the first structure of a member of this new
    transpeptidase family, we have determined the crystal structure of a
    fragment of the l,d-transpeptidase from E. faecium (Ldtfm217) at 2.4 Å
    resolution. Ldtfm217 consists of two domains, the N-terminal domain, a new
    mixed alpha-beta fold, and the ErfK_YbiS_YhnG C-terminal domain, a
    representative of the mainly β class of protein structures. Residue Cys442
    of the C-terminal domain has been proposed to be the catalytic residue
    implicated in the cleavage of the l-Lys-d-Ala peptide bond. Surface analysis
    of Ldtfm217 reveals that residue Cys442 is localized in a buried pocket and
    is accessible by two paths on different sides of the protein. We propose
    that the two paths to the catalytic residue Cys442 are the binding sites for
    the acceptor and donor substrates of the l,d-transpeptidase. © 2006 Elsevier

    The crystal structure of the product of the Bacillus subtilis ykuD gene was
    solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method and refined
    using data to 2.0 Å resolution. The ykuD protein is a representative of a
    distinctly prokaryotic and ubiquitous family found among both pathogenic and
    nonpathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The deduced amino
    acid sequence reveals the presence of an N-terminal LysM domain, which
    occurs among enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, and a novel, putative
    catalytic domain with a highly conserved His/Cys-containing motif of
    hitherto unknown structure. As the wild-type protein did not crystallize, a
    double mutant was designed (Lys117Ala/Gln118Ala) to reduce excess surface
    conformational entropy. As expected, the structure of the LysM domain is
    similar to the NBIR structure reported for an analogous domain from
    Escherichia coli murein transglycosylase MltD. The molecular model also
    shows that the 112-residue-long C-terminal domain has a novel tertiary fold
    consisting of a β-sandwich with two mixed sheets, one containing five
    strands and the other, six strands. The two β-sheets form a cradle capped by
    an α-helix. This domain contains a putative catalytic site with a tetrad of
    invariant His123, Gly124, Cys139, and Arg141. The stereochemistry of this
    active site shows similarities to peptidotransferases and sortases, and
    suggests that the enzymes of the ykuD family may play an important role in
    cell wall biology. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

    Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the main causative agent of tuberculosis,
    is the main reason why this disease continues to be a global public health
    threat. It is  therefore imperative to find a novel antitubercular drug
    target that is unique to  the structural machinery or is essential to the
    growth and survival of the  bacterium. One such target is the enzyme
    l,d-transpeptidase 2, also known as  LdtMt2, a protein primarily responsible
    for the catalysis of 3→3 cross-linkages  that make up the
    mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex of Mtb. In this  study,
    structure-based pharmacophore screening, molecular docking, and in silico 
    toxicity evaluations were employed in screening compounds from a database
    of  synthetic compounds. Out of the 4.5 million database compounds, 18
    structures  were identified as high-scoring, high-binding hits with very
    satisfactory  absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity
    properties. Two out  of the 18 compounds were further subjected to in vitro
    bioactivity assays, with  one exhibiting a good inhibitory activity against
    the Mtb H37Ra strain.

    A new simple empirical function has been developed that estimates the free
    energy of binding for a given protein-ligand complex of known 3D structure.
    The function takes into account hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, the
    lipophilic protein-ligand contact surface and the number of rotatable bonds
    in the ligand. The dataset for the calibration of the function consists of
    45 protein-ligand complexes. The new energy function reproduces the binding
    constants (ranging from 2.5·10-2 to 4·10-14 M, corresponding to binding
    energies between -9 and -76 kJ/mol) of the dataset with a standard deviation
    of 7.9 kJ/mol, corresponding to 1.4 orders of magnitude in binding affinity.
    The individual contributions to protein-ligand binding obtained from the
    scoring function are: ideal neutral hydrogen bond: -4.7 kJ/mol; ideal ionic
    interaction: -8.3 kJ/mol; lipophilic contact: -0.17 kJ/mol Å2; one rotatable
    bond in the ligand: +1.4 kJ/mol. The function also contains a constant
    contribution (+5.4 kJ/mol) which may be rationalized as loss of
    translational and rotational entropy. The function can be evaluated very
    fast and is therefore also suitable for application in a 3D database search
    or de novo ligand design program such as LUDI.

    The transpeptidase LtdMt2 catalyzes the formation of the (3-3) cross-links
    characteristic of the peptidoglycan layer in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis
    cell wall. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the extramembrane part of
    the enzyme consists of three domains: two smaller domains (denoted as A and
    B domains) and a transpeptidase domain (the C domain) at the C-terminus. The
    crystal structures of two fragments comprising the AB domains and the BC
    domains have been determined. The structure of the BC module, which was
    determined to 1.86 Å resolution using Se-SAD phasing, consists of the B
    domain with an immunoglobulin-related fold and the catalytic domain
    belonging to the ErfK/YbiS/YbnG fold family. The structure of the AB-domain
    fragment, which was solved by molecular replacement to 1.45 Å resolution,
    reveals that despite a lack of overall sequence identity the A domain is
    structurally very similar to the B domain. Combining the structures of the
    two fragments provides a view of the complete three-domain extramembrane
    part of LdtMt2 and shows that the protein extends at least 80-100 Å from the
    plasma membrane into the peptidoglycan layer and thus defines the maximal
    distance at which cross-links are formed by this enzyme. The LdtMt-related
    transpeptidases contain one or two immunoglobulin domains, which suggests
    that these might serve as extender units to position the catalytic domain at
    an appropriate distance from the membrane in the peptidoglycan layer. © 2013

    structurally very similar to the B domain. Combining the structures of the
    two fragments provides a view of the complete three-domain extramembrane
    part of LdtMt2 and shows that the protein extends at least 80-100 Å from the
    plasma membrane into the peptidoglycan layer and thus defines the maximal
    distance at which cross-links are formed by this enzyme. The LdtMt-related
    transpeptidases contain one or two immunoglobulin domains, which suggests
    that these might serve as extender units to position the catalytic domain at
    an appropriate distance from the membrane in the peptidoglycan layer. © 2013

    Production of non-canonical D-amino acids (NCDAAs) in stationary phase
    promotes remodelling of peptidoglycan (PG), the polymer that comprises the
    bacterial cell wall. Impairment of NCDAAs production leads to excessive
    accumulation of PG and hypersensitivity to osmotic shock; however, the
    mechanistic bases for these phenotypes were not previously determined. Here,
    we show that incorporation of NCDAAs into PG is a critical means by which
    NCDAAs control PG abundance and strength. We identified and reconstituted in
    vitro two (of at least three) distinct processes that mediate NCDAA
    incorporation. Diverse bacterial phyla incorporate NCDAAs into their cell
    walls, either through periplasmic editing of the mature PG or via
    incorporation into PG precursor subunits in the cytosol. Production of
    NCDAAs in Vibrio cholerae requires the stress response sigma factor RpoS,
    suggesting that NCDAAs may aid bacteria in responding to varied
    environmental challenges. The widespread capacity of diverse bacteria,
    including non-producers, to incorporate NCDAAs suggests that these amino
    acids may serve as both autocrine-and paracrine-like regulators of chemical
    and physical properties of the cell wall in microbial communities. © 2011

    The Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptidoglycan is cross-linked mainly by
    l,d-transpeptidases (LDTs), which are efficiently inactivated by a single 
    β-lactam class, the carbapenems. Development of carbapenems for
    tuberculosis  treatment has recently raised considerable interest since
    these drugs, in  association with the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid,
    are uniformly active  against extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis and
    kill both exponentially  growing and dormant forms of the bacilli. We have
    purified the five  l,d-transpeptidase paralogues of M. tuberculosis (Mt1 to
    -5) and compared their  activities with those of peptidoglycan fragments and
    carbapenems. The five LDTs  were functional in vitro since they were active
    in assays of peptidoglycan  cross-linking (Mt5), β-lactam acylation (Mt3),
    or both (Mt1, Mt2, and Mt4). Mt3  was the only LDT that was inactive in the
    cross-linking assay, suggesting that  this enzyme might be involved in other
    cellular functions such as the anchoring  of proteins to peptidoglycan, as
    shown in Escherichia coli. Inactivation of LDTs  by carbapenems is a
    two-step reaction comprising reversible formation of a  tetrahedral
    intermediate, the oxyanion, followed by irreversible rupture of the 
    β-lactam ring that leads to formation of a stable acyl enzyme. Determination
    of  the rate constants for these two steps revealed important differences
    (up to  460-fold) between carbapenems, which affected the velocity of
    oxyanion and acyl  enzyme formation. Imipenem inactivated LDTs more rapidly
    than ertapenem, and both  drugs were more efficient than meropenem and
    doripenem, indicating that  modification of the carbapenem side chain could
    be used to optimize their  antimycobacterial activity.

    We present a new method for isothermal rigid body simulations using the
    quaternion representation and Langevin dynamics. It can be combined with the
    traditional Langevin or gradient (Brownian) dynamics for the translational
    degrees of freedom to correctly sample the canonical distribution in a
    simulation of rigid molecules. We propose simple, quasisymplectic
    second-order numerical integrators and test their performance on the TIP4P
    model of water. We also investigate the optimal choice of thermostat
    parameters. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

    For a number of years MDL products have exposed both 166 bit and 960 bit
    keysets based on 2D descriptors. These keysets were originally constructed
    and optimized  for substructure searching. We report on improvements in the
    performance of MDL  keysets which are reoptimized for use in molecular
    similarity. Classification  performance for a test data set of 957 compounds
    was increased from 0.65 for the  166 bit keyset and 0.67 for the 960 bit
    keyset to 0.71 for a surprisal S/N pruned  keyset containing 208 bits and
    0.71 for a genetic algorithm optimized keyset  containing 548 bits. We
    present an overview of the underlying technology  supporting the definition
    of descriptors and the encoding of these descriptors  into keysets. This
    technology allows definition of descriptors as combinations of  atom
    properties, bond properties, and atomic neighborhoods at various
    topological  separations as well as supporting a number of custom
    descriptors. These  descriptors can then be used to set one or more bits in
    a keyset. We constructed  various keysets and optimized their performance in
    clustering bioactive  substances. Performance was measured using methodology
    developed by Briem and  Lessel. "Directed pruning" was carried out by
    eliminating bits from the keysets  on the basis of random selection, values
    of the surprisal of the bit, or values  of the surprisal S/N ratio of the
    bit. The random pruning experiment highlighted  the insensitivity of keyset
    performance for keyset lengths of more than 1000  bits. Contrary to initial
    expectations, pruning on the basis of the surprisal  values of the various
    bits resulted in keysets which underperformed those  resulting from random
    pruning. In contrast, pruning on the basis of the surprisal  S/N ratio was
    found to yield keysets which performed better than those resulting  from
    random pruning. We also explored the use of genetic algorithms in the 
    selection of optimal keysets. Once more the performance was only a weak
    function  of keyset size, and the optimizations failed to identify a single
    globally  optimal keyset. Instead multiple, equally optimal keysets could be
    produced which  had relatively low overlap of the descriptors they encoded.

    A new method for performing molecular dynamics simulations under constant
    pressure is presented. In the method, which is based on the extended system
    formalism introduced by Andersen, the deterministic equations of motion for
    the piston degree of freedom are replaced by a Langevin equation; a suitable
    choice of collision frequency then eliminates the unphysical "ringing" of
    the volume associated with the piston mass. In this way it is similar to the
    "weak coupling algorithm" developed by Berendsen and co-workers to perform
    molecular dynamics simulation without piston mass effects. It is shown,
    however, that the weak coupling algorithm induces artifacts into the
    simulation which can be quite severe for inhomogeneous systems such as
    aqueous biopolymers or liquid/liquid interfaces.

    We present a simple, comprehensive technique for accelerating simulation of
    rare events and calculating free energy profiles in molecular dynamics (MD)
    simulations. The technique is based on two related and complementary methods
    (AXD and BXD), which provide both thermodynamic and kinetic information
    along some reaction coordinate. The idea is to slice the reaction coordinate
    into several "boxes", and then run trajectories, locking them consecutively
    within each box to generate kinetic rate coefficients for exchange between
    neighboring boxes. In this way, a reaction coordinate may be efficiently
    explored, including those regions that would otherwise be visited only
    rarely. Combined with a simple and exact method for renormalizing the
    statistics obtained within each box, the box-to-box rate coefficients permit
    efficient free energy mapping. Tests carried out on model peptides
    demonstrate the utility of the method as well as the validity of the
    detailed balance assumption that underpins the derivations. © 2009 American

    We present an implementation of generalized Born implicit solvent all-atom
    classical molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs
    entirely on CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). We discuss
    the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and
    show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on
    conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different
    precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in
    single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double
    precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or
    double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on
    understanding the implications of the different precision models on the
    outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of
    tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy
    conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein
    dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP
    precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors
    which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations.
    We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical
    results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP
    model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at
    significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides
    performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and
    in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers. © 2012 American

    The peptidoglycan layer is a vital component of the bacterial cell wall. The
    existing paradigm describes the peptidoglycan network as a static structure
    that is cross-linked predominantly by 43 transpeptide linkages. However, the
    nonclassical 33 linkages predominate the transpeptide networking of the
    peptidoglycan layer of nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The
    molecular basis of these linkages and their role in the physiology of the
    peptidoglycan layer, virulence and susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to
    drugs remain undefined. Here we identify MT2594 as an L,D-transpeptidase
    that generates 33 linkages in M. tuberculosis. We show that the loss of this
    protein leads to altered colony morphology, loss of virulence and increased
    susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate during the chronic phase of
    infection. This suggests that 33 cross-linking is vital to the physiology of
    the peptidoglycan layer. Although a functional homolog exists, expression of
    ldt Mt2 is dominant throughout the growth phases of M. tuberculosis. 43
    transpeptide linkages are targeted by one of the most widely used classes of
    antibacterial drugs in human clinical use today, Β-lactams. Recently,
    meropenem-clavulanate was shown to be effective against drug-resistant M.
    tuberculosis. Our study suggests that a combination of L,D-transpeptidase
    and Β-lactamase inhibitors could effectively target persisting bacilli
    during the chronic phase of tuberculosis. © 2010 Nature America, Inc. All

    In the context of molecular dynamics simulations of proteins, the term
    "force field" refers to the combination of a mathematical formula and
    associated parameters that are used to describe the energy of the protein as
    a function of its atomic coordinates. In this review, we describe the
    functional forms and parameterization protocols of the widely used
    biomolecular force fields Amber, CHARMM, GROMOS, and OPLS-AA. We also
    summarize the ability of various readily available noncommercial molecular
    dynamics packages to perform simulations using these force fields, as well
    as to use modern methods for the generation of constant-temperature,
    constant-pressure ensembles and to treat long-range interactions. Finally,
    we finish with a discussion of the ability of these force fields to support
    the modeling of proteins in conjunction with nucleic acids, lipids,
    carbohydrates, and/or small molecules.

    The genus Mycobacterium is best known for its two major pathogenic species,
    M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, the causative agents of two of the world's
    oldest diseases, tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively. M. tuberculosis
    kills approximately two million people each year and is thought to latently
    infect one-third of the world's population. One of the most remarkable
    features of the nonsporulating M. tuberculosis is its ability to remain
    dormant within an individual for decades before reactivating into active
    tuberculosis. Thus, control of cell division is a critical part of the
    disease. The mycobacterial cell wall has unique characteristics and is
    impermeable to a number of compounds, a feature in part responsible for
    inherent resistance to numerous drugs. The complexity of the cell wall
    represents a challenge to the organism, requiring specialized mechanisms to
    allow cell division to occur. Besides these mycobacterial specializations,
    all bacteria face some common challenges when they divide. First, they must
    maintain their normal architecture during and after cell division. In the
    case of mycobacteria, that means synthesizing the many layers of complex
    cell wall and maintaining their rod shape. Second, they need to coordinate
    synthesis and breakdown of cell wall components to maintain integrity
    throughout division. Finally, they need to regulate cell division in
    response to environmental stimuli. Here we discuss these challenges and the
    mechanisms that mycobacteria employ to meet them. Because these organisms
    are difficult to study, in many cases we extrapolate from information known
    for gram-negative bacteria or more closely related GC-rich gram-positive
    organisms.

    Nosé has modified Newtonian dynamics so as to reproduce both the canonical
    and the isothermal-isobaric probability densities in the phase space of an
    N-body system. He did this by scaling time (with s) and distance (with V1/D
    in D dimensions) through Lagrangian equations of motion. The dynamical
    equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their
    two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of
    equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state
    probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, ,
    and , where the x are reduced distances and the two variables and act as
    thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction
    coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent
    of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the
    dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest
    possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator. © 1985 The

    β-lactam antibiotics are ineffective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
    being rapidly hydrolyzed by the chromosomally encoded blaC gene product. The
    carbapenem class of β-lactams are very poor substrates for BlaC, allowing us
    to determine the three-dimensional structure of the covalent BlaC-meropenem
    covalent complex at 1.8 angstrom resolution. When meropenem was combined
    with the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate, potent activity against
    laboratory strains of M. tuberculosis was observed [minimum inhibitory
    concentration (MICmeropenem) less than 1 microgram per milliliter], and
    sterilization of aerobically grown cultures was observed within 14 days. In
    addition, this combination exhibited inhibitory activity against
    anaerobically grown cultures that mimic the "persistent" state and inhibited
    the growth of 13 extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis at
    the same levels seen for drug-susceptible strains. Meropenem and clavulanate
    are Food and Drug Administration - approved drugs and could potentially be
    used to treat patients with currently untreatable disease.

    VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of
    molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic
    acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide
    variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as
    one or more 'representations,' in which each representation embodies a
    particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of
    atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an
    extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and
    regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for
    program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser
    to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and
    function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD
    command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of
    displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a
    number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been
    expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD)
    simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct
    connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of
    MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural
    biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM
    software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is
    written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including
    source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous
    ftp and through the World Wide Web.

    Realistic modeling of biomolecular systems requires an accurate treatment of
    electrostatics, including electronic polarization. Due to recent advances in
    physical models, simulation algorithms, and computing hardware, biomolecular
    simulations with advanced force fields at biologically relevant timescales
    are becoming increasingly promising. These advancements have not only led to
    new biophysical insights but also afforded opportunities to advance our
    understanding of fundamental intermolecular forces. This article describes
    the recent advances and applications, as well as future directions, of
    polarizable force fields in biomolecular simulations.

  abstract: "Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50\_years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far\_short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm."

    A new derivation of the GLYCAM06 force field, which removes its previous
    specificity for carbohydrates, and its dependency on the AMBER force field
    and parameters, is presented. AU pertinent force field terms have been
    explicitly specified and so no default or generic parameters are employed.
    The new GLYCAM is no longer limited to any particular class of biomolecules,
    but is extendible to all molecular classes in the spirit of a smallmolecule
    force field. The torsion terms in the present work were all derived from
    quantum mechanical data from a collection of minimal molecular fragments and
    related small molecules. For carbohydrates, there is now a single parameter
    set applicable to both α- and β-anomers and to all monosaccharide ring sizes
    and conformations. We demonstrate that deriving dihedral parameters by
    fitting to QM data for internal rotational energy curves for representative
    small molecules generally leads to correct rotamer populations in molecular
    dynamics simulations, and that this approach removes the need for phase
    corrections in the dihedral terms. However, we note that there are cases
    where this approach is inadequate. Reported here are the basic components of
    the new force field as well as an illustration of its extension to
    carbohydrates. In addition to reproducing the gas-phase properties of an
    array of small test molecules, condensed-phase simulations employing
    GLYCAM06 are shown to reproduce rotamer populations for key small molecules
    and representative biopolymer building blocks in explicit water, as well as
    crystalline lattice properties, such as unit cell dimensions, and
    vibrational frequencies. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    Carbapenems such as meropenem are being investigated for their potential
    therapeutic utility against highly drug-resistant tuberculosis. These
    β-lactams target the transpeptidases that introduce interpeptide cross-links
    into bacterial peptidoglycan thereby controlling rigidity of the bacterial
    envelope. Treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with the β-lactamase
    inhibitor clavulanate together with meropenem resulted in rapid, polar, cell
    lysis releasing cytoplasmic contents. In Mtb it has been previously
    demonstrated that 3-3 cross-linkages [involving two diaminopimelate (DAP)
    molecules] predominate over 4-3 cross-linkages (involving one DAP and one
    D-alanine) in stationary-phase cells. We purified and analysed peptidoglycan
    from Mtb and found that 3-3 cross-linkages predominate throughout all growth
    phases and the ratio of 4-3/3-3 linkages does not vary significantly under
    any growth condition. Meropenem treatment was accompanied by a dramatic
    accumulation of unlinked pentapeptide stems with no change in the
    tetrapeptide pools, suggesting that meropenem inhibits both a
    D,D-carboxypeptidase and an L,D-transpeptidase. We purified a candidate
    D,D-carboxypeptidase DacB2 and showed that meropenem indeed directly
    inhibits this enzyme by forming a stable adduct at the enzyme active site.
    These results suggest that the rapid lysis of meropenem-treated cells is the
    result of synergistically inhibiting the transpeptidases that introduce

    A detailed description of the events ruling ligand/protein interaction and
    an accurate estimation of the drug affinity to its target is of great help
    in speeding drug discovery strategies. We have developed a
    metadynamics-based approach, named funnel metady-namics, that allows the
    ligandtoenhance the samplingof the target binding sites and its solvated
    states. This method leads to an efficient characterization of the binding
    free-energy surface and an accurate calculation of the absolute
    protein-ligand binding free energy. We illustrate our protocol in two
    systems, benzamidine/ trypsin and SC-558/cyclooxygenase 2. In both cases,
    the X-ray conformation has been found as the lowest free-energy pose, and
    the computed protein-ligand binding free energy in good agreement with
    experiments. Furthermore, funnel metadynamics unveils important information
    about the binding process, suchasthe presence of alternative binding modes
    and the role of waters. The results achieved at an affordable computational
    cost make funnel meta-dynamics a valuable method for drug discovery and for
    dealing with a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and material
    science.

  abstract: "As the number of elucidated protein structures is rapidly increasing, the growing data call for methods to efficiently exploit the structural information for biological and pharmaceutical purposes. Given the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein and a ligand, predicting their binding sites and affinity are a key task for computer-aided drug discovery. To address this task, a variety of docking tools have been developed. Most of them focus on docking in the preset binding sites given by users. To automatically predict binding modes without information about binding sites, we developed a user-friendly blind docking web server, named CB-Dock, which predicts binding sites of a given protein and calculates the centers and sizes with a novel\_curvature-based cavity detection approach, and performs docking with a popular docking program, Autodock Vina. This method was carefully optimized and achieved ~70% success rate for the top-ranking poses whose root mean square deviation (RMSD) were within 2 Å from the X-ray pose, which outperformed the state-of-the-art blind docking tools in our benchmark tests. CB-Dock offers an interactive 3D visualization of results, and is freely available at http://cao.labshare.cn/cb-dock/."

    Drugs for tuberculosis are inadequate to address the many inherent and
    emerging challenges of treatment. In the past decade, ten compounds have
    progressed into the clinical development pipeline, including six new
    compounds specifically developed for tuberculosis. Despite this progress,
    the global drug pipeline for tuberculosis is still insufficient to address
    the unmet needs of treatment. Additional and sustainable efforts, and
    funding are needed to further improve the pipeline. The key challenges in
    the development of new treatments are the needs for novel drug combinations,
    new trial designs, studies in paediatric populations, increased clinical
    trial capacity, clear regulatory guidelines, and biomarkers for prediction
    of long-term outcome. Despite substantial progress in efforts to control
    tuberculosis, the global burden of this disease remains high. To eliminate
    tuberculosis as a public health concern by 2050, all responsible parties
    need to work together to strengthen the global antituberculosis drug
    pipeline and support the development of new antituberculosis drug regimens.

    Summary Effective treatment of tuberculosis is frequently hindered by the
    emerging antimicrobial resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The present
    study evaluates monocyclic β-lactam compounds targeting the mycobacterial
    cell wall remodeling. Novel N-thio-β-lactams were designed, synthesized, and
    characterized on the L,D-transpeptidase-2, a validated target in M.
    tuberculosis. The candidates were evaluated in biochemical assays
    identifying five compounds presenting target-specific kinetic constants
    equal or superior to meropenem, a carbapenem currently considered for
    tuberculosis therapy. Mass spectrometry in line with the crystal structures
    of five target-ligand complexes revealed that the N-thio-β-lactams act via
    an unconventional mode of adduct formation, transferring the thio-residues
    from the lactam ring to the active-site cysteine of LdtMt2. The resulting
    stable adducts lead to a long-term inactivation of the target protein.
    Finally, the candidates were evaluated in vitro against a drug-susceptible
    and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, confirming the
    antimycobacterial effect of these novel compounds.

    A fast, simplified potential-based approach is presented that estimates the
    protein-ligand binding affinity based on the given 3D structure of a 
    protein-ligand complex. This general, knowledge-based approach exploits 
    structural information of known protein-ligand complexes extracted from the 
    Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and converts it into distance-dependent
    Helmholtz  free interaction energies of protein-ligand atom pairs
    (potentials of mean force,  PMF). The definition of an appropriate reference
    state and the introduction of a  correction term accounting for the volume
    taken by the ligand were found to be  crucial for deriving the relevant
    interaction potentials that treat solvation and  entropic contributions
    implicitly. A significant correlation between experimental  binding
    affinities and computed score was found for sets of diverse  protein-ligand
    complexes and for sets of different ligands bound to the same  target. For
    77 protein-ligand complexes taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data  Bank,
    the calculated score showed a standard deviation from observed binding 
    affinities of 1.8 log Ki units and an R2 value of 0.61. The best results
    were  obtained for the subset of 16 serine protease complexes with a
    standard deviation  of 1.0 log Ki unit and an R2 value of 0.86. A set of 33
    inhibitors modeled into a  crystal structure of HIV-1 protease yielded a
    standard deviation of 0.8 log Ki  units from measured inhibition constants
    and an R2 value of 0.74. In contrast to  empirical scoring functions that
    show similar or sometimes better correlation  with observed binding
    affinities, our method does not involve deriving specific  parameters that
    fit the observed binding affinities of protein-ligand complexes  of a given
    training set. We compared the performance of the PMF score, Böhm's  score
    (LUDI), and the SMOG score for eight different test sets of protein-ligand 
    complexes. It was found that for the majority of test sets the PMF score
    performs  best. The strength of the new approach presented here lies in its
    generality as  no knowledge about measured binding affinities is needed to
    derive atomic  interaction potentials. The use of the new scoring function
    in docking studies is  outlined.

    The bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan contains unusual l- and d-amino acids
    assembled as branched peptides. Insight into the biosynthesis of the polymer
    has been hampered by limited access to substrates and to suitable
    polymerization assays. Here we report the full synthesis of the peptide stem
    of peptidoglycan precursors from two pathogenic bacteria, Enterococcus
    faecium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the development of a sensitive
    post-derivatization assay for their cross-linking by l,d-transpeptidases.
    Access to series of stem peptides showed that amidation of free carboxyl
    groups is essential for optimal enzyme activity, in particular the amidation
    of diaminopimelate (DAP) residues for the cross-linking activity of the
    l,d-transpeptidase LdtMt2 from M. tuberculosis. Accordingly, construction of
    a conditional mutant established the essential role of AsnB indicating that
    this DAP amidotransferase is an attractive target for the development of
    anti-mycobacterial drugs.

    Three recently proposed constant temperature molecular dynamics methods by:
    (i) Nosé (Mol. Phys., to be published); (ii) Hoover et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
    48, 1818 (1982)], and Evans and Morriss [Chem. Phys. 77, 63 (1983)]; and
    (iii) Haile and Gupta [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 3067 (1983)] are examined
    analytically via calculating the equilibrium distribution functions and
    comparing them with that of the canonical ensemble. Except for effects due
    to momentum and angular momentum conservation, method (i) yields the
    rigorous canonical distribution in both momentum and coordinate space.
    Method (ii) can be made rigorous in coordinate space, and can be derived
    from method (i) by imposing a specific constraint. Method (iii) is not
    rigorous and gives a deviation of order N -1/2 from the canonical
    distribution (N the number of particles). The results for the constant
    temperature-constant pressure ensemble are similar to the canonical ensemble
    case. © 1984 American Institute of Physics.

    Modern simulation and modeling approaches to investigation of biomolecular
    structure and function rely heavily on a variety of methods?water models?to
    approximate the influence of solvent. We give a brief overview of several
    distinct classes of available water models, with the emphasis on the
    conceptual basis at each level of approximation. The main focus is on
    classes of models most widely used in atomistic simulations, including
    popular implicit and explicit solvent models. Among the latter,
    nonpolarizable N-point models are covered in most detail, including some
    recent methodological advances and nuances. Notes on practical availability
    and usage in biomolecular simulations are included. Atomistic simulations
    that were hardly possible only a short while ago have revealed significant
    problems that can be traced to deficiencies of most commonly used N-point
    water models. Recently developed models of this class approximate
    experimental properties of liquid water much closer than before, and show
    promise in practical biomolecular simulations. Obstacles to wider adoption
    of these more accurate water models, both technical and conceptual, are
    discussed. It is argued that verifying robustness of simulation results to
    the choice of water model can be of immediate benefit even in the absence of
    a clear replacement for older models; a specific strategy is proposed. The
    review is concluded with a discussion on how force-field development efforts
    can benefit from better solvent models, and vice versa. WIREs Comput Mol Sci

    The design, implementation, and capabilities of an extensible visualization
    system, UCSF Chimera, are discussed. Chimera is segmented into a core that
    provides basic services and visualization, and extensions that provide most
    higher level functionality. This architecture ensures that the extension
    mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to
    incorporate new features, Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale,
    which adds the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as
    viral coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera
    session interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions
    include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and
    associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations;
    Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for
    display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of
    Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future
    directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic
    and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple
    Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.

    PyMOL is a molecular viewer, render tool, and 3D molecular editor developed
    in the spirit of RasMol and OpenRasMol and intended for visualization of 3D
    chemical structures including atomic resolution X-ray crystal structures of:
    proteins, nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, & tRNA), and carbohydrates, as well as
    small molecule structures of drug leads, inhibitors, metabolites, sugars,
    nucleoside phosphates, and other ligands including inorganic salts and
    solvent molecules. PyMOL serves academic research and education in chemistry
    and biology, and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries by
    rendering publication-quality journal illustrations of macromolecules
    including drug targets such as GPCRs, kinases (Abl, Raf, Aurora, EGFR),
    proteases (HIV, BACE, Factor Xa), phosophorylases (PTP1B), and other enzyme
    targets, as well as therapeutic biomolecules such as humanized antibodies,
    cytokines, hormones, and serpins. Available molecular representations for
    nanotechnology pictures include space-filling "CPK" atoms, chemical bonds,
    cartoon ribbons, molecular surfaces, and solvent accessible surface meshes.
    As a stereochemistry viewer, PyMOL can illustrate the 3D stereochemical
    relationships of organic chemistry. As a crystallographic protein structure
    viewer, PyMOL can display millions of atoms inside a crystal lattice.
    Molecular interactions can be represented using interatomic distances, van
    der Waals clashes, property-based, potential-based, & proximity-based
    coloring schemes, solid and mesh isosurface potentials, slice planes, and
    gradient field lines. PyMOL also supports input of electron density maps,
    electrostatic potential maps, and other volumetric data sets as well as
    arbitrary 3D geometries comprised of triangles, spheres, cylinders, cones,
    ellipsoids, and text. Output options include copy & paste, PNG images,
    QuickTime Movies (on Mac), VRML, Maya OBJ, and POVRay POV input files.
    Molecular animations can be created through simple object & camera motions
    or through input of trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations and
    other dynamic conformational ensembles such as 3D NMR structures, allosteric
    states, and Monte Carlo configurations. PyMOL can be scripted using Python
    and is available as both an ActiveX Control and a Java/JNI Component. PyMOL
    supports OpenGL hardware from nVidia (3D Vision), ATI/AMD, and Intel, with
    stereoscopic 3D graphics display on devices such as the Planar3D, Samsung
    SyncMaster 2233RZ, Viewsonic Fuhzion VX2265wm & PJD6220-3D, Z…

    We present an automatic method for docking organic ligands into protein
    binding sites. The method can be used in the design process of specific
    protein ligands.  It combines an appropriate model of the physico-chemical
    properties of the docked  molecules with efficient methods for sampling the
    conformational space of the  ligand. If the ligand is flexible, it can adopt
    a large variety of different  conformations. Each such minimum in
    conformational space presents a potential  candidate for the conformation of
    the ligand in the complexed state. Our docking  method samples the
    conformation space of the ligand on the basis of a discrete  model and uses
    a tree-search technique for placing the ligand incrementally into  the
    active site. For placing the first fragment of the ligand into the protein, 
    we use hashing techniques adapted from computer vision. The incremental 
    construction algorithm is based on a greedy strategy combined with
    efficient  methods for overlap detection and for the search of new
    interactions. We present  results on 19 complexes of which the binding
    geometry has been  crystallographically determined. All considered ligands
    are docked in at most  three minutes on a current workstation. The
    experimentally observed binding mode  of the ligand is reproduced with 0.5
    to 1.2 A rms deviation. It is almost always  found among the highest-ranking
    conformations computed.

    ENDscript 2 is a friendly Web server for extracting and rendering a
    comprehensive analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure
    information in an automated way. This major upgrade has been fully
    re-engineered to enhance speed, accuracy and usability with interactive 3D
    visualization. It takes advantage of the new version 3 of ESPript, our
    well-known sequence alignment renderer, improved to handle a large number of
    data with reduced computation time. From a single PDB entry or file,
    ENDscript produces high quality figures displaying multiple sequence
    alignment of proteins homologous to the query, colored according to residue
    conservation. Furthermore, the experimental secondary structure elements and
    a detailed set of relevant biophysical and structural data are depicted. All
    this information and more are now mapped on interactive 3D PyMOL
    representations. Thanks to its adaptive and rigorous algorithm, beginner to
    expert users can modify settings to fine-tune ENDscript to their needs.
    ENDscript has also been upgraded as an open platform for the visualization
    of multiple biochemical and structural data coming from external biotool Web
    servers, with both 2D and 3D representations. ENDscript 2 and ESPript 3 are
    freely available at http://endscript.ibcp.fr and http://espript.ibcp.fr,
    respectively. © 2014 The Author(s).

    We describe PTRAJ and its successor CPPTRAJ, two complementary, portable,
    and freely available computer programs for the analysis and processing of
    time series of three-dimensional atomic positions (i.e., coordinate
    trajectories) and the data therein derived. Common tools include the ability
    to manipulate the data to convert among trajectory formats, process groups
    of trajectories generated with ensemble methods (e.g., replica exchange
    molecular dynamics), image with periodic boundary conditions, create average
    structures, strip subsets of the system, and perform calculations such as
    RMS fitting, measuring distances, B-factors, radii of gyration, radial
    distribution functions, and time correlations, among other actions and
    analyses. Both the PTRAJ and CPPTRAJ programs and source code are freely
    available under the GNU General Public License version 3 and are currently
    distributed within the AmberTools 12 suite of support programs that make up
    part of the Amber package of computer programs (see http://ambermd.org).
    This overview describes the general design, features, and history of these
    two programs, as well as algorithmic improvements and new features available
    in CPPTRAJ. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

    We report here a dehydropeptidase-deficient murine model of tuberculosis
    (TB) infection that is able to partially uncover the efficacy of marketed 
    broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics alone and in combination. Reductions of
    up to  2 log CFU in the lungs of TB-infected mice after 8 days of treatment
    compared to  untreated controls were obtained at blood drug concentrations
    and time above the  MIC (T>MIC) below clinically achievable levels in
    humans. These findings provide  evidence supporting the potential of
    β-lactams as safe and mycobactericidal  components of new combination
    regimens against TB with or without resistance to  currently used drugs.

    Molecular dynamics (MD) allows the study of biological and chemical systems
    at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds. It
    complements experiment while also offering a way to follow processes
    difficult to discern with experimental techniques. Numerous software
    packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used
    is termed Amber. Here, we outline the most recent developments, since
    version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD
    software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest
    release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by
    multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work
    beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber
    package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of
    important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas.
    We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and
    where things are likely to head over the coming years. Figure 1 shows the
    performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD
    FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680. ©

    We present an implementation of explicit solvent all atom classical
    molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs entirely
    on CUDA-enabled GPUs. First released publicly in April 2010 as part of
    version 11 of the AMBER MD package and further improved and optimized over
    the last two years, this implementation supports the three most widely used
    statistical mechanical ensembles (NVE, NVT, and NPT), uses particle mesh
    Ewald (PME) for the long-range electrostatics, and runs entirely on
    CUDA-enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs), providing results that
    are statistically indistinguishable from the traditional CPU version of the
    software and with performance that exceeds that achievable by the CPU
    version of AMBER software running on all conventional CPU-based clusters and
    supercomputers. We briefly discuss three different precision models
    developed specifically for this work (SPDP, SPFP, and DPDP) and highlight
    the technical details of the approach as it extends beyond previously
    reported work [Götz et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012, DOI:
    10.1021/ct200909j; Le Grand et al., Comp. Phys. Comm. 2013, DOI:
    10.1016/j.cpc.2012.09.022].We highlight the substantial improvements in
    performance that are seen over traditional CPU-only machines and provide
    validation of our implementation and precision models. We also provide
    evidence supporting our decision to deprecate the previously described fully
    single precision (SPSP) model from the latest release of the AMBER software
    package. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

    Beta-lactams, in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, are reported to
    have activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria growing in broth,
    as well as  inside the human macrophage. We tested representative
    beta-lactams belonging to 3  different classes for activity against
    replicating M. tuberculosis in broth and  nonreplicating M. tuberculosis
    under hypoxia, as well as against  streptomycin-starved M. tuberculosis
    strain 18b (ss18b) in the presence or  absence of clavulanate. Most of the
    combinations showed bactericidal activity  against replicating M.
    tuberculosis, with up to 200-fold improvement in potency  in the presence of
    clavulanate. None of the combinations, including those  containing
    meropenem, imipenem, and faropenem, killed M. tuberculosis under  hypoxia.
    However, faropenem- and meropenem-containing combinations killed strain 
    ss18b moderately. We tested the bactericidal activities of
    meropenem-clavulanate  and amoxicillin-clavulanate combinations in the acute
    and chronic aerosol  infection models of tuberculosis in BALB/c mice. Based
    on  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic indexes reported for beta-lactams
    against other  bacterial pathogens, a cumulative percentage of a 24-h period
    that the drug  concentration exceeds the MIC under steady-state
    pharmacokinetic conditions  (%TMIC) of 20 to 40% was achieved in mice using
    a suitable dosing regimen. Both  combinations showed marginal reduction in
    lung CFU compared to the late controls  in the acute model, whereas both
    were inactive in the chronic model.

    Complex systems that bridge the traditional disciplines of physics,
    chemistry, biology, and materials science can be studied at an unprecedented
    level of detail using increasingly sophisticated theoretical methodology and
    high-speed computers. The aim of this book is to prepare burgeoning users
    and developers to become active participants in this exciting and rapidly
    advancing research area by uniting for the first time, in one monograph, the
    basic concepts of equilibrium and time-dependent statistical mechanics with
    the modern techniques used to solve the complex problems that arise in
    real-world applications. The book contains a detailed review of classical
    and quantum mechanics, in-depth discussions of the most commonly used
    ensembles simultaneously with modern computational techniques such as
    molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo, and important topics including
    free-energy calculations, linear-response theory, harmonic baths and the
    generalized Langevin equation, critical phenomena, and advanced
    conformational sampling methods. Burgeoning users and developers are thus
    provided firm grounding to become active participants in this exciting and
    rapidly advancing research area, while experienced practitioners will find
    the book to be a useful reference tool for the field.

    R.E.D. Server is a unique, open web service, designed to derive
    non-polarizable RESP and ESP charges and to build force field libraries for
    new molecules/molecular fragments. It provides to computational biologists
    the means to derive rigorously molecular electrostatic potential-based
    charges embedded in force field libraries that are ready to be used in force
    field development, charge validation and molecular dynamics simulations.
    R.E.D. Server interfaces quantum mechanics programs, the RESP program and
    the latest version of the R.E.D. tools. A two step approach has been
    developed. The first one consists of preparing P2N file(s) to rigorously
    define key elements such as atom names, topology and chemical equivalencing
    needed when building a force field library. Then, P2N files are used to
    derive RESP or ESP charges embedded in force field libraries in the Tripos
    mol2 format. In complex cases an entire set of force field libraries or
    force field topology database is generated. Other features developed in
    R.E.D. Server include help services, a demonstration, tutorials, frequently
    asked questions, Jmol-based tools useful to construct PDB input files and
    parse R.E.D. Server outputs as well as a graphical queuing system allowing
    any user to check the status of R.E.D. Server jobs.

    The equation of motion of a system of 864 particles interacting through a
    Lennard-Jones potential has been integrated for various values of the
    temperature and density, relative, generally, to a fluid state. The
    equilibrium properties have been calculated and are shown to agree very well
    with the corresponding properties of argon. It is concluded that, to a good
    approximation, the equilibrium state of argon can be described through a
    two-body potential. © 1967 The American Physical Society.

    The huge number of hardware and software components, together with a large
    number of parameters affecting the performance of each parallel application,
    makes ensuring the efficiency of a large scale supercomputer extremely
    difficult. In this situation, all basic parameters of the supercomputer
    should be constantly monitored, as well as many decisions about its
    functioning should be made by special software automatically. In this paper
    we describe the tight connection between complexity of modern large high
    performance computing systems and special techniques and tools required to
    ensure their efficiency in practice. The main subsystems of the developed
    complex (Octoshell, DiMMoN, Octotron, JobDigest, and an expert software
    system to bring fine analytics on parallel applications and the entire
    supercomputer to users and sysadmins) are actively operated on the large
    supercomputer systems at Lomonosov Moscow State University. A brief
    description of the architecture of Lomonosov-2 supercomputer is presented,
    and questions showing both a wide variety of emerging complex issues and the
    need for an integrated approach to solving the problem of effectively
    supporting large supercomputer systems are discussed.

    As one of the most popular computational approaches in modern
    structure-based drug design, molecular docking can be used not only to
    identify the correct  conformation of a ligand within the target binding
    pocket but also to estimate  the strength of the interaction between a
    target and a ligand. Nowadays, as a  variety of docking programs are
    available for the scientific community, a  comprehensive understanding of
    the advantages and limitations of each docking  program is fundamentally
    important to conduct more reasonable docking studies and  docking-based
    virtual screening. In the present study, based on an extensive  dataset of
    2002 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBbind database (version  2014), the
    performance of ten docking programs, including five commercial  programs
    (LigandFit, Glide, GOLD, MOE Dock, and Surflex-Dock) and five academic 
    programs (AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, LeDock, rDock, and UCSF DOCK), was 
    systematically evaluated by examining the accuracies of binding pose
    prediction  (sampling power) and binding affinity estimation (scoring
    power). Our results  showed that GOLD and LeDock had the best sampling power
    (GOLD: 59.8% accuracy for  the top scored poses; LeDock: 80.8% accuracy for
    the best poses) and AutoDock  Vina had the best scoring power (rp/rs of
    0.564/0.580 and 0.569/0.584 for the top  scored poses and best poses),
    suggesting that the commercial programs did not  show the expected better
    performance than the academic ones. Overall, the ligand  binding poses could
    be identified in most cases by the evaluated docking programs  but the ranks
    of the binding affinities for the entire dataset could not be well 
    predicted by most docking programs. However, for some types of protein
    families,  relatively high linear correlations between docking scores and
    experimental  binding affinities could be achieved. To our knowledge, this
    study has been the  most extensive evaluation of popular molecular docking
    programs in the last five  years. It is expected that our work can offer
    useful information for the  successful application of these docking tools to
    different requirements and  targets.

    We propose a modification in the three-dimensional Ewald summation technique
    for calculations of long-range Coulombic forces for systems with a slab
    geometry that are periodic in two dimensions and have a finite length in the
    third dimension. The proposed method adds a correction term to the standard
    Ewald summation formula. To test the current method, molecular dynamics
    simulations on water between Pt(111) walls have been carried out. For a more
    direct test, the calculation of the pair forces between two point charges
    has been also performed. An excellent agreement with the results from
    simulations using the rigorous two dimensional Ewald summation technique
    were obtained. We observed that a significant reduction in computing time
    can be achieved when the proposed modification is used. © 1999 American
